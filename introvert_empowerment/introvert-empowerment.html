                <h2 class="vision">Vision</h2>
                <p>Our goal with this project was not only to build an amazing app, but
                    it was also to truly help people who have a legitiment desire to improve a part of their life.
                    Many introverts, like myself, would love to be a little more outgoing from time to time.
                    My team build this app to provide ideas on how to do just that.
                </p>
                <h2 class="design">Design</h2>
                <p>Being our capstone project, we felt it was extremely important to have a presentable UI
                    along with a functionally top notch back end. We took everything we've learn through out our course
                    and packed as much of it into this app as we could.
                    A few notes about design:
                </p>
                <ul class="unlist">
                    <li>The front end utilizes an ecouraging message of the day which comes from an API</li>
                    <li>The three main sections for user imporovement consist of,
                        tasks which he or she can choose from, a task mamnger, and phone notifications</li>
                    <li>Users can create a profile which they can log in from any device and save information to their
                        profile</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bootstrap was the main CSS framework used on this project. </p>

                <p>This project was very challenging. We completed all the base requirements and moved on to extra
                    features that made this app standout.
                    Here are some of the features within our code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>API call with a timer to populate only one per 24 hours
                    </li>
                    <li>User profiles that are password protected and can hold user saved data</li>
                    <li>The ability to link your app to your phone to receive text reminders to complete tasks</li>
                    <li>Establishing a connection between multiple many to many tables for each user</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="code-examples">Code Examples</h2>
                <p>Here are some examples of my code in the project.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The first image of the app.js page shows the use of useEffect in order to deisable buttons
                            when necessary.
                            In addition you can see the use of onSet for the diffferent lists.
                            This portion of the code helped the children to talk to the parent and then back to the
                            chilren again.</p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="react-1.jpeg" alt="react 1 image" class="react-1-img" />
                        <br>
                        <p>The next two images are part of one of the first API fetches.
                            The TypeList.js image shows the API call based on a type of date
                            and the image that shows 'function Type' show how 'type' is used to fill in the information
                            for the API call.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="react-2.jpeg" alt="react 2 image" class="react-2-img" />
                        <img src="react-3.jpeg" alt="react 3 image" class="react-3-img" />

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Below is an image of the second API call which finds a location for the date idea that the
                            user chooses.
                            The string that was found from the first API is automatically inserted into the second API
                            without any human intervention from the user.
                            ***********************Additionally, you will see the 'Bearer Id' has been hidden for
                            privacy purposes.***************************************************

                <h2 class="reflect">Project Reflection</h2>
                <p>This was the first project that I worked on by myself.
                    It was much easier to formulate a plan a strategy for this project and time management was much less
                    complicated.
                    There were many moments in the this project where I really had to stretch my mind and search for
                    information in resources.
                    The most difficult portion was getting the string from the first API fetch to populate in the second
                    API fetch.
                    I am very pleased with the functional results and look forward to revisiting the project to add a
                    small amount of visual interest.

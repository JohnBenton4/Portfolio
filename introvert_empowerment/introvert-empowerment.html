                <h2 class="vision">Vision</h2>
                <p>Our goal with this project was not only to build an amazing app, but
                    to truly help people who have a legitimate desire to improve a part of their life.
                    Many introverts, like myself, would love to be a little more outgoing from time to time.
                    My team built this app to provide ideas on how to do just that.
                </p>
                <h2 class="design">Design</h2>
                <p>Being our capstone project, we knew it was extremely important to have a visually clean UI
                    along with a functionally top notch back end. We took everything we've learn through out our course
                    and packed as much of it into this app as we could.
                    A few notes about design:
                </p>
                <ul class="unlist">
                    <li>The front end utilizes an encouraging message of the day which comes from an API</li>
                    <li>The three main sections for user improvement consist of,
                        challenges to choose from, a task manager, and phone notifications</li>
                    <li>Users can create a profile which they can log in from any device and save information to their
                        profile</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bootstrap was the main CSS framework used on this project. </p>

                <p>This project was very challenging. We completed all the base requirements and moved on to extra
                    features that made this app standout.
                    Here are some of the features within our code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>API call with a timer to populate only one per 24 hours</li>
                    <li>User profiles that are password protected and can hold user saved data</li>
                    <li>The ability to receive text reminders to your phone to complete tasks(forth coming)</li>
                    <li>Establishing a connection between several many to many tables for each user</li>
                    <li>The project can be located here:
                        <a href="https://github.com/JohnBenton4/Introvert-Empowerment">Introvert Empowerment</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>The live deployment can be found here: <a href="https://john-b-portfolio.netlify.app/"> Live</a></li>

                <h2 class="code-examples">Code Examples</h2>
                <p>Here are some examples of my code in the project.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The first image of the server.js file demonstrates our structure for getting and posting.
                            Additionally, part of the bcrypt set up is also on the server file.
                            As mentioned before, the bcrypt was a very challenging part of the project which is an idea I intend on
                            exploring further.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="introvert-1.jpeg" alt="introvert 1 image" class="introvert-1-img" />
                        <br>
                        <p>The next image shows a small example of one of our many model files used in this project. I built models for the 
                            challenges, conversations, and pickup lines. All those tables are linked to the users table through three separate tables
                            forming the many to many relationships.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="introvert-2.jpeg" alt="introvert 2 image" class="introvert-2-img" />
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>The last image below contains code for what we are calling the Projects file. This file contains cards that are responsive
                            and are really the heart of the functionality of the project. The cards contain the challenges, the task manager, and 
                            the phone text reminder options.
                        </p>
                        <img src="introvert-3.jpeg" alt="introvert 3 image" class="introvert-4-img" />
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <div>
                <h2 class="reflect">Project Reflection</h2>
                <p>My group worked very well together on our capstone project, and in a relatively short time we were able to create 
                    an app that surpassed the requirements set forth for the assignment. I learned how to implement bcrypt, how 
                    to create several many to many relationships within one app, how to host websites live through Heroku, and much more.
                    I enjoy learning new skills and strategies with each project I work on and continue to have a better understanding of best practices
                    for front end and back end work.

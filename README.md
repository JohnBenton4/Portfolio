My portfolio is a conglomeration of the must recent work I've done. I'm proud of what I've accomplished, and I know I have so much farther to grow and learn. The future of web development is promising, and I look forward to finding out how my contributions will shape this field.

## Goals
<ul>
<li><strong>I completed my first goal in October of 2022, which was to graduate from a challenging coding boot camp with the skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the industry.</strong> 
</li>
<li><strong>My second goal is to find an employer who gives me the opportunity to contribute, influence, learn, and grow.
</strong> </li>
<li><strong>My third goal is to make a lasting positive difference for others using technology as my medium. I want to make the world an objectively better place.
</strong> </li>
</ul>

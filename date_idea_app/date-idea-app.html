                <p>My goal in this project was to create an app that could be used by people just like me.
                    I have a hard time thinking of fun date ideas, and even when I do, often times I'm not sure where I could go to for the date idea I come up with.
                    This app solves those problems.

                <h2 class="design">Design</h2>
                <p>A clear and clean UI was important for me on this project. The emphasis is on the functionality.
                    A few notes about design:
                </p>
                <ul class="unlist">
                    <li>I wanted the UI to be unassuming (letting the user use it inconspicuously) if they needed to plan something as a surprise</li>
                    <li>There are three options to choose from, but only one per submit</li>
                    <li>After choosing one of the first search options, the other two submit buttons become disabled</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A small amount of bootstrap was used to give the submit buttons a streamlined look. </p>

                <p>My team created a fun app that successfully utilized two different APIs. Here are some of the
                    features within our code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a 'Back' button to return to the landing page from the trivia page or the joke page
                    </li>
                    <li>Wrote proper async/await functions to handle the APIs</li>
                    <li>We were able to randomly sort the answers on the page and let the user know when the correct
                        answer was selected</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="code-examples">Code Examples</h2>
                <p>Here are some examples of my code in the project.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>We felt it was necessary to use window.onload so the entire page would load before the API is
                            called.
                            This allowed smoother page loads and we also had to option to add a 'loading' notification
                            if we wanted.
                            The next notable item is the random sort of the correct answer to the API. Doing this
                            allowed for a more realistic game feel.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The second image below shows basic set up of the button element, however, the more
                            interesting portions of the code begin halfway down the image.
                            I created a correctButton which held the correct answer. Because the correct answer was
                            being randomly moved on each new question, the correctButton element had to move with it.
                            The last part to note is the message alert when the user selects the correct answer. The
                            alert shows up at the top of the web page.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Below is our index.html code. We added some fun animation on the landing page and incorporated bootstrap for styling.
                            There are several APIs on the landing page that are used for the animation.
                        </p>

                <p>My group worked very well together.
                    In only a few days, we were able to turn a rough idea into a fully functional game using API
                    calls. This was my first project as a web developer.
                    I learned so much not only from a strictly coding stand point, but also in terms of planning,
                    communication, time management, and expectations.

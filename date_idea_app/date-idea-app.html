                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>We set out to build a back-end project that would be the skeleton for an e-commerce website.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="design">
                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>Design took a back seat in this project as the main objectives were to understand postgreSQL, tables, and bcrypt.
                    The design we did decide on is reminiscent of the Supreme web store with minimal visual stimulus and wording on the landing page.
                    A few notes about design:
                </p>
                <ul class="unlist">
                    <li>We settled on a clear landing page with distinct pictures for each category</li>
                    <li>It was important to choose images that are easily recognizable so the audiences attention would be captured right away.</li>
                    <li>Lastly regarding design, having examples of the products on the landing page not only lets the user know what they can expect from each category, 
                        but also presents the most valuable imformation immediately.</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
                <p>One of our team members chose to manually create all the CSS from scratch instead of utilizing a framework. 
                    He wanted extra practice with design and this gave him that opportunity.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/react-img.jpeg" alt="sticker united image" class="sticker-united-img" />
        </div>
        <div class="results">
            <h1>Results</h1>
            <div class="features">
                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>The team was able to create a solid beginning to an e-commerce site. 
                    Coincidentally, a member of our team actually sells custom stickers as a side hustle. 
                    Our hope is that he will be able to use this site in the future to break into the market. 
                    Here are some of the features within our code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Login page with credentials protected by bcrypt</li>
                    <li>Ability to select any sticker as a favorite and add it to your profile</li>
                    <li>Ability to create an account</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>

            <div class="reflect">Project Reflection
                <p>The team had a great time working on this project. 
                    Each person had specific areas of the code they focused on, however, we collaborated through out the project making sure to stay on track and on time.
                    Communicating early and often proved to be the most valuable strategy during this project. 
                    Our efficient communication helped us to finish the project in the short time we were alotted.

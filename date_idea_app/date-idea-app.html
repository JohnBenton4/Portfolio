                <p>My goal in this project was to create an app that could be used by people just like me.
                    I have a hard time thinking of fun date ideas, and even when I do, often times I'm not sure where I
                    could go to for the date idea I come up with.
                    This app solves those problems.

                <h2 class="design">Design</h2>
                <p>A clear and clean UI was important for me on this project. The emphasis is on the functionality.
                    A few notes about design:
                </p>
                <ul class="unlist">
                    <li>I wanted the UI to be unassuming (letting the user use it inconspicuously) if they needed to
                        plan something as a surprise</li>
                    <li>There are three options to choose from, but only one per submit</li>
                    <li>After choosing one of the first search options, the other two submit buttons become disabled
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>A small amount of bootstrap was used to give the submit buttons a streamlined look. </p>

                <p>I really enjoyed working on this challenging project.
                    I explored beyond the requirements to create a more technocally complex application.
                    Here are some of the features within our code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discovered what CORS is and found a solution for CORS errors.
                    </li>
                    <li>Successfully fetched information from an API and then inserted that infomation into a second API
                        search to get the final results</li>
                    <li>Disabled submit buttons after another submit button was clicked</li>
                    <li>Used basic bootstrap to streamline the look if the submit buttons</li>
                    <li>The use of useEffect</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2 class="code-examples">Code Examples</h2>
                <p>Here are some examples of my code in the project.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The first image of the app.js page shows the use of useEffect in order to deisable buttons
                            when necessary.
                            In addition you can see the use of onSet for the diffferent lists.
                            This portion of the code helped the children to talk to the parent and then back to the
                            chilren again.</p>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <p>The next two images are part of one of the first API fetches. 
                            The TypeList.js image shows the API call based on a type of date 
                            and the image that shows 'function Type' show how 'type' is used to fill in the information for the API call.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                    <li>
                        <p>Below is an image of the second API call which finds a location for the date idea that the user chooses.
                            The string that was found from the first API is automatically inserted into the second API without any human intervention from the user.

                <h2 class="reflect">Project Reflection</h2>
                <p>This was the first project that I worked on by myself. 
                    It was much easier to formulate a plan a strategy for this project and time management was much less complicated.
                    There were many moments in the this project where I really had to stretch my mind and search for information in resources.
                    The most difficult portion was getting the string from the first API fetch to populate in the second API fetch.
                    I am very pleased with the functional results and look forward to revisiting the project to add a small amount of visual interest.

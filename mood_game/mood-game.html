                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>We set out to build a front-end project that could be not only entertaining but also fun and informative.

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>An important design factor was to keep the UI simple and give it a basic feel.
                    The design emphasis is on the information on the page and has an 80's video game feel.
                    A few notes about design:

                <ul class="unlist">
                    <li>Landing page needed to be simple abd easy to understand</li>
                    <li>The use of theater faces, comedy and tragedy, is an homage to age old entertainment but in a twenty-first century web app</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
                <p>We used bootstrap due to its flexibility and ease of use. </p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>My team created a fun app that successfully utilized two different APIs. Here are some of the features within our code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a 'Back' button to return to the landing page from the trivia page or the joke page</li>
                    <li>Wrote proper async/await functions to handle the APIs</li>
                    <li>We were able to randomly sort the answers on the page and let the user know when the correct answer was selected.</li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>

                <p>My group worked very well together. 
                    In only a few days, we were able to turn a rough idea into a fully functional game using API calls.

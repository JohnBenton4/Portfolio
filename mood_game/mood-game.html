          <p>
            We set out to build a front-end project that could be not only
            entertaining but also fun and informative.
          </p>
          <h2 class="design">Design</h2>
          <p>
            An important design factor was to keep the UI simple and give it a
            basic feel. The design emphasis is on the information on the page
            and has an 80's video game feel. A few notes about design:
          </p>
          <ul class="unlist">
            <li>Landing page needed to be simple and easy to understand</li>
            <li>
              The use of theater faces, comedy and tragedy, is an homage to age
              old entertainment but in a twenty-first century web app
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We used bootstrap due to its flexibility and ease of use.</p>

          <p>
            My team created a fun app that successfully utilized two different
            APIs. Here are some of the features within our code:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Added a 'Back' button to return to the landing page from the
              trivia page or the joke page
            </li>
            <li>Wrote proper async/await functions to handle the APIs</li>
            <li>
              We were able to randomly sort the answers on the page and let the
              user know when the correct answer was selected
            </li>
            <li>
              The project can be located here:
              <a href="https://github.com/JohnBenton4/Trivia">Mood Game</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              The live deployment can be found here:
              <a href="https://mood-game.netlify.app/"> Live</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="code-examples">Code Examples</h2>
          <p>Here are some examples of my code in the project.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                We felt it was necessary to use window.onload so the entire page
                would load before the API is called. This allowed smoother page
                loads and we also had to option to add a 'loading' notification
                if we wanted. The next notable item is the random sort of the
                correct answer to the API. Doing this allowed for a more
                realistic game feel.
                <br />
                <br />
                The second image below shows basic set up of the button element,
                however, the more interesting portions of the code begin halfway
                down the image. I created a correctButton which held the correct
                answer. Because the correct answer was being randomly moved on
                each new question, the correctButton element had to move with
                it. The last part to note is the message alert when the user
                selects the correct answer. The alert shows up at the top of the
                web page.

                Below is our index.html code. We added some fun animation on the
                landing page and incorporated bootstrap for styling. There are
                several APIs on the landing page that are used for the
                animation.
              </p>

          <h2 class="reflect">Project Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            My group worked very well together. In only a few days, we were able
            to turn a rough idea into a fully functional game using API calls.
            This was my first project as a web developer. I learned so much not
            only from a strictly coding stand point, but also in terms of
            planning, communication, time management, and expectations.
